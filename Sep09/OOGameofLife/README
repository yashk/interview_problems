Problem 1 - Game of life.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
grid of square cells, each of which is in one
of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight
neighbours, which are the cells that are
directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
time, the following transitions occur:

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
loneliness.
  2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
overcrowding.
  3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to
the next generation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.

The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first
generation is created by applying the above rules
simultaneously to every cell in the seed — births and deaths happen
simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which
this happens is sometimes called a tick. (In other words, each generation
is a pure function of the one before.) The
rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

Problem.
The inputs below represent the cells in the universe as X or - . X is a
alive cell. - is a dead cell or no cell .
The below inputs provide the provide pattern or initial cells in the
universe . The output is the state of the system
in the next tick (one run of the application of all the rules) ,
represented in the same format.

I have taken following assumptions while developing this coding problem:-
1.The size of the grid or universe is 25 * 25, but this is configurable.
2.The patterns would not grow out of universe the while applying the game of life rules.
